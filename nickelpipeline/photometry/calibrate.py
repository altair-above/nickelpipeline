    Iteratively determine the photometric calibration coefficients by
    fitting the data and then rejecting outliers.

    Procedure:

        - Determine the best-fitting coefficients using
          :func:`photometric_calibration_coefficients`.
        - Use :func:`apply_photometric_calibration` to apply the
          coefficents to the instrumental magnitudes.
        - Reject outliers; see ``rej``.
        - Repeat until either no points are rejected or the maximum
          number of iterations is reached.

    Parameters

    mag_i : `numpy.ndarray`
        Measured instrumental magnitudes, :math:`-2.5\log_{10}(f)` with
        :math:`f` in counts.  Shape is :math:`(N_{\rm obs}, N_{\rm
        band})`, where :math:`N_{\rm obs}` is the number of independent
        observations and :math:`N_{\rm band}` is the number of broadband
        filters used.

        2)`.  The array contents provide the column indices in ``mag_c``
        and ``mag_i`` for constructing the color.  E.g.,
        ``color_defs=np.array([[0,1],[2,1], ... ]) means use

        calibrate the fluxes in ``mag_i[:,0]``, use

        calibrate the fluxes in ``mag_i[:,1]``, etc.
    order : :obj:`int`, optional
        Order of the color terms.  Order=1 adopts only linear terms; see
        :func:`photometric_calibration_coefficients`.

    Apply photometric calibration coefficients to a set of observations.

    The photometric calibration coefficients are defined by a *known*
    set of stellar colors.  Therefore, this function runs iteratively.
    The first guess at the colors use the instrumental magnitudes.  For
    each iteration, the colors are updated based on the apparent
    magnitudes measured in the previous iteration, and the apparent
    magnitudes are recalculated.  These iterations proceed until the rms
    difference between the original and updated colors is less than
    ``atol`` or the maximum number of iterations (``maxiter``) as been
    reached.

        is the number of independent observations and :math:`N_{\rm
        band}` is the number of broadband filters used.
    airmass : `numpy.ndarray`
        Airmass of each observation.  Shape must match ``mag``.
    coeff : `numpy.ndarray`
        Best-fit calibration coefficients; one set per broadband filter.
    color_defs : `numpy.ndarray`
        An array indicating how to construct the color used for
        calibrating each magnitude.  Shape must be :math:`(N_{\rm band},
        2)`.  The array contents provide the column indices in ``mag_c``
        and ``mag_i`` for constructing the color.  E.g.,
        ``color_defs=np.array([[0,1],[2,1], ... ]) means use
        ``mag_c[:,0]-mag_c[:,1]`` to construct the color used to
        calibrate the fluxes in ``mag_i[:,0]``, use
